Scenario

Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

Ask
Three questions will guide the future marketing program:

How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?

Prepare¶
I will use Cyclistic’s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this license. Datasets are avilable here.

Key tasks
[x] Download data and store it appropriately.

Data has been downloaded from here and copies have been stored securely on my computer and here on Kaggle.
[x] Identify how it’s organized.

All trip data is in comma-delimited (.CSV) format. Column names "ride_id", "rideable_type", "started_at", "ended_at", "start_station_name", "start_station_id", "end_station_name", "end_station_id", "start_lat", "start_lng", "end_lat", "end_lng", "member_casual" (Total 13 column)
[x] Sort and filter the data.

For this analysis I'm going to use last 12 months data of the year 2021, as it's the more current period to the business task.
[x] Determine the credibility of the data.

For the purposes of this case study, the datasets are appropriate and it will enable me to answer the business questions. But due data-privacy I cannot use rider's personally identification information, and this will prevent me from determining if a single user/rider taken several rides. All ride ids are unique in this data-set.
Deliverable
[x] A description of all data sources used

Main source of data provided by the Cylistic company.
